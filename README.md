## Silhouette Validating Clustering Model (Unsupervised-Machine-Learning)
Silhouette is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering models in unsupervised machine learning. It is used to assess how well the data points within a cluster are separated from each other and how well they are grouped together relative to other clusters.

## Value Range (-1 to 1)
The Silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1.
- With a score closer to 1 indicating that the data point is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly-matched to neighboring clusters.
- A score of 0 indicates that the data point is close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.
- A negative score indicates that the data point may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

## Formula 
The formula for calculating the Silhouette score for a data point is as follows:

s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max{a(i), b(i)}

where
- s(i) is the Silhouette score for the data point i
- a(i) is the average distance between i and all other data points in the same cluster
- b(i) is the average distance between i and all data points in the nearest neighboring cluster
- max{a(i), b(i)} takes the maximum value of either a(i) or b(i)
The Silhouette score for an entire clustering model can be calculated as the mean Silhouette score of all the data points in the model.


# Description 

To calculate the Silhouette score for a data point i, you need to compute two distances:

- a(i) is the average distance between i and all other data points in the same cluster as i.
- b(i) is the average distance between i and all data points in the nearest neighboring cluster (i.e., the cluster with the smallest average distance to i that is       different from the cluster that i is in).
- 
Once you have these distances, you can compute the Silhouette score s(i) as:

s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))

The maximum function in the denominator is used to avoid division by zero.

### S(i) is zero 
If a(i) = b(i), then s(i) = 0, which means that the data point is on the border between two clusters. 
If s(i) is negative, then the data point is closer to neighboring clusters than to its own cluster, indicating that it may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

To calculate the Silhouette score for an entire clustering model, you simply take the average Silhouette score of all data points in the model:

s = (1/n) * sum(s(i)), where i = 1 to n.

Here, n is the total number of data points in the model, and s(i) is the Silhouette score for each individual data point i.


## Conclusion
In general, a higher Silhouette score indicates a better clustering model, but the optimal score may depend on the specific problem and the domain of the data being clustered. Therefore, it is often necessary to compare the Silhouette scores of multiple models to determine which one performs the best.
